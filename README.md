# Dice-Game
This project is a simple web-based dice game called "Dicee." It features an interactive interface where two players can roll dice by refreshing the page. The webpage displays two dice images, one for each player, and updates them randomly to simulate rolling. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project aims to provide a fun time with friends.
